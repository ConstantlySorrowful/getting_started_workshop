### Target audience
This workshop is for embedded systems developers desiring to leverage advanced tools and techniques to accelerate their development workflow.

### Necessary background knowledge
Fundamental understanding of the ARM architectures, Real-time operating systems (RTOS), AWS Management console, AWS IAM. Basic programming skills in C and Python is also recommended.

### What you are going to learn
The purpose of this workshop is to provide you with guidance on using a CI/CD workflow for building IoT solutions using ARM Virtual Hardware (AVH), Keil Studio Cloud (KSC) and AWS IoT services.

### Duration
The expected duration for running all the labs in this workshop is 4 hours. This estimate does not include time for learning the fundamentals of ARM and AWS technology.

### Costs
All resources created in this workshop are billed based on pay-per-use principle. We estimate the total costs of AWS resources necessary for this workshop to be below $2 if you use them for 24 hours, and below 10$ if you use them for 7 days. Main cost driver for this workshop is the Amazon EC2 instance.
