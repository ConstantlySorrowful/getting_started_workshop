The **Arm Virtual Hardware (AVH) Targets** provide a functional accurate simulation of an Arm-based SoC and can be automated for scalable deployment in the CI development flow. This virtual platform can be used standalone or with development tools such as Arm Development Studio or Arm Keil MDK with debug and trace capabilities supported as well.

The **AVH Targets** are based on the Arm Fast Model technology and are extended FVP models that add virtual interfaces for peripheral emulation. In addition AVH provides concepts to re-target applications from simulation models to physical hardware which simplifies to combine unit/integration tests with the final system integration.
