### IAM - Create an S3 Bucket

You will also need an S3 Bucket to support the CI/CD workflow automation.

Open the AWS Console in your browser and navigate to the S3 service page. 

- Select **Create Bucket**
- Enter a globally unique name for your new bucket
- Select a region.
- Scroll down. All other defaults should be acceptable
  - (By default: **Block all public** access is selected. Please leave it selected. This keeps it private to you.)
- Click **Create Bucket**
