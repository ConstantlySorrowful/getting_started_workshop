## Clone example code from GitHub

Now we are ready to get started with some example code. In this step we will clone a repository from GitHub. This repository contains a project that implements MQTT Mutual Authentication with FreeRTOS and is configured to use CMSIS-Packs. We will then compile the project using the command line tools from the cmsis-toolbox we installed earlier.


Open a terminal to the EC2 instance and follow these steps.

```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/<your account>/avh-workshop.git
```
