## CMSIS Overview

The Common Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) is a vendor-independent abstraction layer for microcontrollers that are based on Arm Cortex processors. CMSIS defines generic tool interfaces and enables consistent device support. The CMSIS software interfaces simplify software reuse, reduce the learning curve for microcontroller developers, and improve time to market for new devices.

CMSIS provides interfaces to processor and peripherals, real-time operating systems, and middleware components. CMSIS includes a delivery mechanism for devices, boards, and software, and enables the combination of software components from multiple vendors.

## Install CMSIS-Packs

**What are CMSIS-Packs?**

CMSIS-Pack is an effective packaging technology that currently supports close to 9,000 different microcontrollers. They provide a delivery mechanism for software components, device parameters, and evaluation board support. A Software Pack (file collection) includes:

- Source code, header files, and software libraries
- Documentation and source code templates
- Device parameters along with startup code and programming algorithms
- Example projects

**The CMSIS-Pack system solves several problems:**

- It provides meta-data of files that relate to a software component. All files that belong to a software component can be identified and information about the original provider is preserved.
- It enables consistent software component upgrade and identifies incompatible configuration files that may be part of the user application.
- Software component providers can specify the interfaces and relationship to other software components.
- The meta-data of a software component can include dependency information for toolchains, devices, and processors which simplifies the integration into application programs.

[Open CMSIS Packs ](https://www.open-cmsis-pack.org/)

You will need several **CMSIS-Packs** installed for the workshop labs. Although some will have already been installed when the AMI was prepared, you can install any additional as needed using the **cpackget** command. The .cprj project file will also add any required packs so this script is not mandatory. This example of using **cpackget** is provided to show management of your pack repository. 

New packs are continually being developed. It is generally a good idea to update your local index occasionally.

```bash
cpackget index -f https://www.keil.com/pack/index.pidx
```
Or if you have installed a newer version of the [cmsis-toolbox](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/releases) a slightly different syntax will work.

```bash
cpackget update-index
```

Create a script file to add the CMSIS-Packs we will need in the workshop.

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/bin
cat << EOF > $HOME/bin/addcpacks.sh
cpackget -q pack add -a ARM::CMSIS
