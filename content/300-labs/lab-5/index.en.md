# AWS IoT Device Shadows

In this lab you will continue in Keil Studio Cloud (KSC) to learn about using **AWS IoT Device Shadows**. Shadows can make a deviceâ€™s state available to apps and other services whether the device is connected to AWS IoT or not. Your Thing's state is maintained in a JSON document. Both your device and cloud applications subscribing to the shadow's state changes will be notified when something changes. Even when your device loses connectivity, it is able to recover the correct state when connectivity is restored.

Please see [AWS IoT Device Shadow service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html) for more details.
