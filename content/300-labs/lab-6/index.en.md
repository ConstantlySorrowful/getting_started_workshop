# AWS IoT Device Jobs

In this lab you will continue in Keil Studio Cloud (KSC) to learn about using **AWS IoT Device Jobs**. AWS IoT Jobs enable you to define a set of remote operations that can be sent to and run on one or more devices connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices to download and install applications, run firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting operations.
