This workshop demonstrates how to setup a development workflow with cloud-based Continuous Integration (CI) for testing an IoT application that connects to AWS cloud services.

The application can be tested using Arm Virtual Hardware. Code development and debug can be done locally, for example with CMSIS-Toolbox and Keil MDK tools. In this workshop you will learn how to use Keil Studio Cloud that provides a cloud-native development environment.

Automated test execution is managed with GitHub Actions and gets triggered on every code change in the repository. The program gets built and run on Arm Virtual Hardware cloud infrastructure in AWS and the test results can be then observed in repository's GitHub Actions.

Arm Virtual Hardware is a new feature integrated into Keil Studio Cloud and is not yet openly available. In order to work throught the labs in this workshop you will need to request access to have this feature enabled in your Arm account. Please send email to **aws-avh-workshop@arm.com** to request access.

This workshop is also still undergoing development. As the features of Arm Virtual Hardware, Keil Studio Cloud, and FreeRTOS integration of CMSIS-Packs continue to mature, new and improved labs will be added. Additional content is being added increnmentally. Please check back and watch for new content. If you have requested access using the email address above, you will get notified automatically. Please report any issues encountered. We will endevor to update as quickly as possible.
